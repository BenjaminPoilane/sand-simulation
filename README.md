# Sand simulation

This is a basic simulation of a granular medium with up to 1'000 spherical grains (perhaps more depending on the machine) with 0, 1 or 2 larger spheres. This is done with a simple [collision algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_detection).

## Files

 - `sand_simulation.exe` is the executable file of the simulation (for windows only). You have to select parameters 7 parmaters. A set-up example can be
	- inelasticity coefficient r = 0.9
	- number of small spheres = 500
	- mass of small spheres = 1
	- radius of small spheres = 7
	- number of big spheres = 1
 	- radius of big spheres = 70
	- mass of big spheres = 1000
	- gravity = 0
 - `Sand2_04_02` is the associated .jar file.
